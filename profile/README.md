## Hi, welcome to the MadMachine community👋


📣Yes, now Swift language can run on microcontrollers. Previously, you may primarily program iOS apps using Swift. Now, you can control various hardware and build interactive projects by writing Swift code. This is a completely new experience!

We keep exploring the usage of the Swift language on microcontrollers. So far, we have created a whole platform for you: [hardware boards](https://www.tindie.com/stores/madmachine/), SDK and supporting material (tutorials, projects...) to help you get started and learn new skills. 

It's perfect for hobbyists, students, and professionals who want to create interactive projects that can do anything from blinking an LED to reading a temperature sensor to controlling a motor:

* control lights💡, motors🛵
* play music🎶
* read data from various sensors📝
* display images and UI on screens🌄
* construct a plant watering system🌱
* make popular games like Tetris, pong...🎮
* ...

It's a fun and creative way to bring your ideas to life! The possibilities are endless. You can use it to create almost any type of electronic project you can imagine.
